I never finished this project, becourse i went on with Pimatic and PebbleMatic, my own project to control via Pebble. See http://maxwinterstein.github.io/pebblematic/ for more info.

# PiControl

PiControl is a small front/back-end for my houseautomation project. Mostly is was designed to stay as a little backend-service to use with an Pebble. 

Written in the deepest night, quicker than Flash and dirtier than Sasha Grey.

It uses Raspberry-Remote as server backend (https://xkonni.github.io/raspberry-remote/), Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com) and jQuery (https://jquery.com).

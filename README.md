# PiControl

PiControl is a small front/back-end for my houseautomation project. Mostly is was designed to stay as a little backend-service to use with an Pebble. 
Written in the deepest night, quicker that Flash and dirty like Sasha Gray.

It uses Raspberry-Remote as server backend. (https://xkonni.github.io/raspberry-remote/)
